# 🎭 Playwright + Postman Integration Framework

A robust and scalable testing framework combining **Playwright** for UI automation and **Postman/Newman** for API validation — all in a unified TypeScript project.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ TypeScript-based Playwright tests
- ✅ Postman API tests triggered dynamically via Newman
- ✅ `.env` support for secure token management
- ✅ Automatic syncing of updated auth tokens
- ✅ Clean folder structure for scalability
- ✅ Git and `.gitignore` ready

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

\`\`\`bash
npm install
npx playwright install
\`\`\`

### 2. Run All Tests

\`\`\`bash
npx playwright test
\`\`\`

This will:
- Trigger Postman tests via Newman
- Run Playwright UI tests afterward
- Sync the latest \`authToken\` back into \`.env\`

---

## 🔐 Environment Management

- Auth tokens are dynamically generated during test runs.
- Tokens are saved to \`.env\` for reuse across test flows.
- \`.env\` is safely excluded from Git via \`.gitignore\`.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Node.js v18+
- Playwright
- Newman CLI
- Git (for version control)

---

## 🧪 Sample API Flow

1. Logs in via Postman collection
2. Extracts and stores token
3. Uses token in subsequent requests
4. Passes token to Playwright if needed

---

## 📊 Test Reports

After running `npx playwright test`, two reports are generated:

### ▶️ UI Test Report
- Location: `reports/ui/index.html`
- Generated by: Playwright
- Usage: Open in a browser to view detailed UI test results

### 🌐 API Test Report
- Location: `reports/api/newman-report.html`
- Generated by: Newman (Postman)
- Usage: View individual API request/response and assertion results

> These reports are excluded from Git via `.gitignore` and are intended for local development and debugging only.
