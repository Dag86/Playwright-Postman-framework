# 🌭 Playwright + Postman Integration Framework

A robust and scalable testing framework combining **Playwright** for UI automation and **Postman/Newman** for API validation — all in a unified TypeScript project.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
```

### 2. Run All Tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

This will:
- Trigger Postman tests via Newman
- Run Playwright UI tests afterward
- Sync the latest `authToken` back into `.env`

---

## 🔐 Environment Management

- Auth tokens are dynamically generated during test runs.
- Tokens are saved to `.env` for reuse across test flows.
- `.env` is safely excluded from Git via `.gitignore`.

---

## 📆 Requirements

- Node.js v18+
- Playwright
- Newman CLI
- Git (for version control)

---

## 🦢 Sample API Flow

1. Logs in via Postman collection
2. Extracts and stores token
3. Uses token in subsequent requests
4. Passes token to Playwright if needed

---

## 📊 Test Reports

After running `npx playwright test`, two reports are generated:

### ▶️ UI Test Report
- Location: `reports/ui/index.html`
- Generated by: Playwright
- Usage: Open in a browser to view detailed UI test results

### 🌐 API Test Report
- Location: `reports/api/newman-report.html`
- Generated by: Newman (Postman)
- Usage: View individual API request/response and assertion results

> These reports are excluded from Git via `.gitignore` and are intended for local development and debugging only.
